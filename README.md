require('keytrail').setup({
    padding = "  ",     -- Padding before the path
    hover_delay = 20,   -- Delay in milliseconds before showing popup
    colors = {
        "#d4c4a8",      -- Soft yellow
        "#c4d4a8",      -- Soft green
        "#a8c4d4",      -- Soft blue
        "#d4a8c4",      -- Soft purple
